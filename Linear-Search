Linear search
An example of a computer searching 
algorithm
 is linear search. This is a simple algorithm used to find a value in a list of 
data
. The algorithm runs as follows:

Identify a search term.
Look at the first item in the list.
Compare the item with the search term.
Is the current item the same as the search term? If so, the item has been found. If not, move to the next item.
Repeat from step two until the last item in the list has been reached.
If the end of the list has been reached and the search term has not been found, then the search term is not in the list and the algorithm can stop.
Linear search example
This algorithm could be used to search the following list for the number 1:

3, 2, 4, 1, 5

The algorithm would produce:

3, 2, 4, 1, 5 (1 compared to 3 - not found)

3, 2, 4, 1, 5 (1 compared to 2 - not found)

3, 2, 4, 1, 5 (1 compared to 4 - not found)

3, 2, 4, 1, 5 (1 compared to 1- found)
