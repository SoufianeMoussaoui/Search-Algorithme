Searching algorithms are techniques used to locate a target element within a collection of data. 
The choice of searching algorithm depends on factors such as the size and organization of the dataset, the nature of the target element,
and the efficiency requirements of the application.
Commonly used searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and more. Each algorithm has its own characteristics, advantages, and limitations

# Linear Search  : 

Linear search, often known as sequential search, is the most basic search technique. 
In this type of search, you go through the entire list and try to fetch a match for a single element. 
If you find a match, then the address of the matching target element is returned. 

On the other hand, if the element is not found, then it returns a NULL value. 

Following is a step-by-step approach employed to perform Linear Search Algorithm
 
 1 Initialization : Start at the first element (index 0).

2 Comparison : Compare the current element with the target.

3 Check for Match :

    . If it matches, return the index.
   
    . If not, move to the next element.
   
4 Repeat : Continue until all elements are checked.

5 End of List : If the target is not found, return -1 or None
